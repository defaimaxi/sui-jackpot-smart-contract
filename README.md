#  Jackpot Smart Contract
The Sui Jackpot Smart Contract is a decentralized, blockchain-powered lottery and jackpot system built on the Sui Network. This contract enables users to participate in a provably fair, transparent, and trustless lottery system where they can purchase tickets, enter draws, and potentially win rewards. The smart contract leverages Sui's high throughput and low latency to provide a seamless and scalable lottery experience.

## Features

Transparent Jackpot System: The smart contract ensures that all transactions and the jackpot process are completely transparent and verifiable.

Decentralized: No centralized authority controls the jackpot; the contract is self-executing and autonomous.

Sui Blockchain Integration: Built on the Sui Network, known for its fast transaction speeds and scalability.

User-Friendly: Players can easily purchase tickets and check jackpot statuses through a lightweight front-end interface.

Provably Fair: The lottery mechanism is designed to be tamper-proof, with transparent random number generation for prize determination.

Low Transaction Fees: Suiâ€™s efficient architecture minimizes transaction fees, ensuring low-cost participation for users.


## How It Works
Ticket Purchase: Users can purchase lottery tickets directly via the smart contract. The cost of each ticket can be specified in the contract.

Random Winner Selection: Once the draw is initiated, the contract generates a random number to select a winner from the list of ticket holders.

Prize Distribution: The jackpot prize pool is distributed to the selected winner, and a portion of the funds can be allocated to a funding pool for future draws or operational expenses.

Withdrawal: Winners can claim their rewards directly through the contract with secure transaction handling.
